# Futhorc

Futhorc is a static site generator for building my personal blog--**it's not
intended, recommended, or supported for broader uses**. It's written in Go and
uses a Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) architecture for efficient
builds (see [the blog
post](https://blog.weberc2.com/posts/efficient-ssg-with-csp.html) for details).
